# PAMAM
## Power analysis for admixture mapping

PAMAM is a tool for performing the power and sample size analysis for two-way and three-way admixture mapping studies.
The R codes provided here are free to download, use, and distribution for non-commercial purpose. The online PAMAM tool can be accessed from https://research.cchmc.org/mershalab/PAMAM/login.html.

For power and sample size analysis, download the R files and load to the R environemnt.

          source('~/AMPower_2way.R')

          source('~/AMPower_3way.R')

Usages of two-way analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/MershaLab/PAMAM/blob/master/Three-way%20usages.docx). For details and examples, please check the [supplemental file](http://www.genetics.org/content/207/3/873.supplemental) of our AdmixPower article in Genetics.  

Usages of three-way analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/MershaLab/PAMAM/blob/master/Three-way%20usages.docx).
